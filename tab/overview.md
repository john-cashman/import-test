Cursor Tab is our native autocomplete feature. It's a more powerful Copilot that suggests entire diffs with especially good memory.


  


Powered by a custom model, Cursor Tab can:

* Suggest edits around your cursor, not just insertions of additional code.
* Modify multiple lines at once.
* Make suggestions based on your recent changes and linter errors.

Free users receive 2000 suggestions at no cost. Pro and Business plans receive unlimited suggestions.

### UI

When Cursor is only adding additional text, completions will appear as grey text. If a suggestion modifies existing code,
it will appear as a diff popup to the right of your current line.


  
  


You can accept a suggestion by pressing `Tab`, or reject it by pressing `Esc`. To partially accept a suggestion word-by-word, press `Ctrl/⌘ →`. 
To reject a suggestion, just keep typing, or use `Escape` to cancel/hide the suggestion.

Every keystroke or cursor movement, Cursor will attempt to make a suggestion based on your recent changes. However, Cursor will not always show a suggestion; sometimes the model has predicted that there's no change to be made.

Cursor can make changes from one line above to two lines below your current line.

### Toggling

To turn the feature on or off, hover over "Cursor Tab" icon on the status bar in the bottom right of the application.
