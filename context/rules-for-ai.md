You can add custom instructions to Cursor by modifying the `Rules for AI` section under `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Rules for AI`.

This custom instruction will be included for features such as Cursor Chat and Ctrl/⌘ K.





### `.cursorrules`

For project-specific instructions, you can include the instructions in a `.cursorrules` file in the root of your project.

As the same as the "Rules for AI" section, the instructions in the `.cursorrules` file will be included for features such as Cursor Chat and Ctrl/⌘ K.
