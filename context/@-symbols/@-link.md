### `@https://your-link.com`

In order for Cursor to visit a link before responding, type `@` and then paste in the link. 






### Remove Links

By default, we automatically parse links and turn them into `@Links` in Cursor Chat.
If you prefer to have the link as plain text, click on the link and then click `Unlink`.
