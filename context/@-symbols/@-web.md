### `@Web`





With `@Web`, Cursor constructs a search query based on the query and the context you've provided, and searches the web to 
find relevant information as additional context. This is particulary useful for finding the most up-to-date information.

### Always On

You can make Cursor search the web for chat on every query by turning on "Always search the web" under `Cursor settings` > `Features` > `Chat`. This is
equivalent to using `@web` on every query.
