Currently, `@Git` is only supported in the Cursor Chat.


### `@Git`

In Cursor's Chat, you can use `@Git` to add git commits, diffs, or pull requests to your prompt.






### Common Use Cases

One common use case for `@Git` is to allow Cursor's AI to scan the diff and look for bugs or issues that could be caused by the diff.





You could also use `@Diff of Working State` to generate a commit message from your current diffs.
